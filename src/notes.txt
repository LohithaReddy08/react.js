important features of reactJs:-
*****************************

1. ReactJs is javascript library to build rich reusable user interface.
2. ReactJs is faster because of "virtual DOM".
3. React follows component based architecture.
4. React follows unidirectional data flow.
5. React follows both Client-side rendering and server-side rendering.

- React was introduced in 2011 by facebook.
- Jordan walke.
- React is a free and platform-independent.

- npm init react-app myapp
- npx create-react-app myapp
- vite react


- React is mainly used to create single page applications.


what is virtual DOM:
- Virtual DOM is a virtual representation of a UI which is kept in a memory later 
 synced with Real DOM with the help of a library called "ReactDOM".

ex: <h1></h1>

components:
***********
- components are the files/modules which consist of js related logics which can be reuse.
comonents are divided intlo two types:-
1.class bases components(cbc)
2.functional based components(fbc)

1.class bases components(cbc)
- cbc is similar to javascript es6 class.
syntax:-

class Person{
construction(name , age){
this.name=name;
this.age=age;
}
}
class Child extend Person{
constructor(name , age , city){
super(name , age);
this.city=city;
}
}

syntax:-
class App extends React.Component{
render

2.functional based components(fbc)
-fbc are similar to 


component composition:-
**********************
- component composite is used to combine multiple component into single applications

props:-
******
- props is nothing but a properties similar to html attributes
- props is an object.
- props is an object used to transfer data from parent to child component

props.childern:- it is a special type of prop used to pass the data / component as a prop to

prop drilling:- it is used to pass the data down to child


functiona components:-
- by default function component stateless because there is no state object.
- in react v16.8 , they introduce a concept called as "Hooks"
syntax:- Hooks is nothing but a function which implement
